\newcommand{\LectureDescription}{Early-career mathematicians - those who are close to finishing their doctorates or have recently finished - are invited to a fortnight of apprenticeship in combinatorial algebraic geometry. For an intense two weeks (21 August 2016 - 3 September 2016), we will get our hands dirty exploring new problems and keep our computers spinning with many calculations. Led by Bernd Sturmfels, participants will learn new skills of the trade, networks with peers, and practice their craft.}
